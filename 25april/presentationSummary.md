# Presentation Summary
150-250 words: Write a summary of your presentation, including the discussion that followed your presentation.

For my presentation, I discussed how culture affects people's general attitudes toward robots. I was initially intrigued by the idea of the everlasting human quest across cultures for the life "made, not born". If this human quest has spanned across time, I am curious as to how it extends across cultures in modern day. More specifically, I am interested in how different emphases varied aspects of social interactions could influence how different cultures view as ideal robots.

To address this big research question, I focused my presentation on three sub-questions:
1. **What is culture?**

Is it language, social norms, media we consume, or something else?

2. **What robots are we interacting with?**

In which context is this robot positioned? Is it service, military, household, or something else? What does it look like: human, machine, or pet?

3. **Who are the people in question?**

Do our attitudes change depending on our age, gender, education, prior experience with robots, etc.?

Overall, I emphasize that there is no conclusive result, for different experiments and studies which I discuss more in detail present us with conflicting results depending on the factors considered. Hence, I end the discussion with more questions than answers such as:
1. What is the general attitude toward robots that you experienced in your home culture/country?
2. Should robots be considered tools or “social beings”? Does the context matter?
3. What do you think of cultural adaptation? Should all cultural beliefs and behaviors be adapted to?
4. Can robots form their own culture? What might a “robot culture” look like?
