Our reading consisted of three articles that were on free will and robots. We explored the articles, one by one, and posed two questions from each.

**1. The Non-existent Moral Agency of Robots â€“ A Lack of Intentionality and Free Will by Florence Simon**

For this reading, we first examined Simon's countering argument against the article she was trying to rebuke and asked the class if her example of self-driving car really fit under the definition of "autonomous, intentional, and responsible moral agent". Then, we discussed further about her comparison between human genetics and robot code to see if the class agreed with such a comparison.

**2. Free will and AI by Chuan Hiang Teng**

For this reading, we raised the question of whether we truly have the free will to step out of "an infinite loop", as claimed by Teng. Then, we also discussed whether the free will is truly free only when it is not limited by physicality, hence when the action comes to its fruition.

**3. Killer robots, free will and the illusion of control by Simon Watson**

For this reading, we use the trolley problem discussed in the reading but put the agency on the self-driving car to examine if our reactions of the same outcome might be different depending on who the agent is. Then, with this in mind, we raise the question of whether or not we trust robots or humans and to what extent and in which context.
