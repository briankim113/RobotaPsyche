**Topic**: Different cultural attitudes towards and understanding of robots

While reading the introduction of *Gods and Robots*, I was intrigued by the idea of the everlasting human quest across cultures for the life "made, not born".
If this human quest has spanned across time, I am curious as to how it extends across cultures in modern day.
More specifically, I am interested in how different emphases varied aspects of social interactions could influence how different cultures view as ideal robots.
